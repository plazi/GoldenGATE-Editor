This project is provides the GoldenGATE Editor Core, default user interface,
and desktop application, as well as many unitilty and convenience classes for
building plug-ins.


This project requires the JAR files build by the Ant script in the idaho-core
project (http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/) and the JAR files referenced from
there. See http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/source/browse/README.txt for the
latter. You can either check out idaho-core as a project into the same workspace
and build it first, or include the JAR files it generates in the "lib" folder.
