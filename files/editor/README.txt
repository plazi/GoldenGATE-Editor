GoldenGATE Document Editor



REQUIRED JAVA VERSION

Sun (r) Java Runtime Environment 1.5.0 or higher



STARTING THE PROGRAM

To start GoldenGATE Editor, you have several options:

- Double click GoldenGate.exe

- Double click GoldenGateStarter.jar (works on all operating systems if executing jar files is supported)

- On Microsoft Windows: execute GoldenGATE.bat (will invoke GoldenGateStarter.jar)

- On Linux / MacOS: execute GoldenGATE.sh (will invoke GoldenGateStarter.jar)

Starting GoldenGATE.jar directly may work, but is discouraged. In particular,
the prefixed starter process GoldenGateStarter.jar is responsible for down-
loading and installing updates for the GoldenGATE core components, and starting
GoldenGATE with specific parameters for the Java Virtual Machine. Without these
parameters, GoldenGATE may run slowly or crash due to lack of memory.
