are Annotation sources that use existing Annotations to create new ones.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">The Reasoners Menu</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Markup Converters menu provides access to
functions for managing and applying Markup Converters, and access to a set of
functions for direct markup conversion:</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Environment Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Do
    reasoning over the Tokens neighboring Annotations of a particular type,
    comparing them to the neighboring Tokens of Annotations of another type.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Value Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Do reasoning
    over the values of Annotations of a particular type (the value of an
    Annotation is the text it encloses), finding new occurences of these values
    in the document.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Clone Annotations:</b>&nbsp;Clone
    Annotations of a particular type, leaving aside other occurences of their
    values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Value Environment Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Combination
    of value and environment reasoning, can be applied iteratively.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Token Fraction Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Do
    reasoning based on the individual Tokens enclosed in Annotations of a
    particular type, targeting Annotations of another type, regarding the
    fraction of Tokens enclosed by them that was also enclosed by Annotations of
    the first type.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Token Sequence Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do
    reasoning based on the individual Tokens enclosed in Annotations of a
    particular type, finding new sequences of these Tokens.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Join Annotations:</b>&nbsp;Join
    neighboring Annotations of the same type.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Apply:</b>&nbsp;Apply some sort of
    reasoning to the document currently selected. This function is also
    available through the&nbsp;<b>Apply Reasoner </b>option in the Tools menu.
    Since there is only one Reasoner that acts in different ways, there is no
    selection list for Reasoners.</font></li>
</ul>
<h4><font face="Verdana">The Apply Reasoner Dialog</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The dialog for Annotation reasoning pops up
whenever reasoning is to be applied. It collects the necessary parameters for
the particular reasoning mode selected, or additionally allows selecting the
reasoning mode by choosing the coresponding parameter tab if no reasoning mode
is selected initially.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Environment Reasoning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Environment reasoning makes use of Tokens
neighboring the Annotations of a particular source type for qualifying
Annotations of a particular target type, which is different from the source type.
In particular, an Annotation of the target type is qualified if it has the same
environment as some Annotation of the source type. Environment reasoning uses
the following parameters:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to collect the environments from.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Match
    the environments case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symmetric Environment:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;If
    checked, use the same number of Tokens to the left and right of the source
    type Annotations. Otherwise, use the Left Tokens and Right Tokens numbers.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Env(ironment) Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the left and
    right of the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Left Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    non-symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the left of
    the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    non-symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the right of
    the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Target Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of Annotations whose environments to compare to the environments of the
    source type Annotations.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume using 2-Token symmertric
environments of &quot;location&quot; Annotations for reasoning over &quot;properName&quot;
Annotations. Further assume the following two sentences from some document (Annotations
marked with XML tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;When John F. Kennedy came to &lt;location&gt;Washinghton&lt;/location&gt;,
he was the first catholic to become president of the US.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &quot;When Adenauer first came to &lt;properName&gt;Bonn&lt;/properName&gt;,
he had just survived the war.&quot;<br>
The 2-Token symmetric environment of &quot;Washington&quot; is &quot;came to ,
he&quot;. Since this matches the 2-Token symmetric environment of
&quot;Bonn&quot;, the Reasoner would conclude that &quot;Bonn&quot; is a
location, just as &quot;Washington&quot;.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Value Reasoning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Value reasoning extracts the values of Annotations
of a particular source type (the value of an Annotation is the text it encloses)
and annotates all occurences of these values in the document. Value reasoning
uses only two parameters:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to collect the values from.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Match
    the values case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume value reasoning on &quot;location&quot;
Annotations in the following two sentences from some document (Annotations
marked with XML tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;Every child knows that &lt;location&gt;Washinghton&lt;/location&gt;
is the capital of the USA.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &quot;When John F. Kennedy came to Washinghton, he was the first catholic
to become president of the US.&quot;<br>
Since &quot;Washington&quot; is annotated as a location in the first sentence,
it would be annotated as a location in the second sentence as well.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Annotation Cloning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Annotation cloning simply duplicates the existing
Annotations of a given type. Value reasoning
uses only one parameter:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to clone.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;is
also displayed because it is necessary for all other reasoning modes, but has no
influence.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Value / Environment Reasoning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Value / environment reasoning combines the two
previous reasoning modes and applies them iteratively for a given number of
rounds or until nither of them produces any new Annotations. It takes the same
parameters as environment reasoning, plus the number of rounds:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to collect the environments from.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Match
    the environments case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symmetric Environment:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;If
    checked, use the same number of Tokens to the left and right of the source
    type Annotations. Otherwise, use the Left Tokens and Right Tokens numbers.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Env(ironment) Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the left and
    right of the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Left Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    non-symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the left of
    the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;For
    non-symmetric environments, the number of Tokens to collect to the right of
    the source type Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rounds:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Maximum
    number of iterations. Setting it to 0 will cause the reasoner to iterate
    until nither the value reasoning not the environment reasoning produces any
    new Annotations.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Target Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of Annotations whose environments to compare to the environments of the
    source type Annotations.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume using 2-Token symmertric
environments of &quot;location&quot; Annotations for reasoning over &quot;properName&quot;
Annotations. Further assume the following three sentences from some document (Annotations
marked with XML tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;Every child knows that &lt;location&gt;Washinghton&lt;/location&gt;
is the capital of the USA.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &quot;When John F. Kennedy came to Washinghton, he was the first catholic
to become president of the US.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &quot;When Adenauer first came to &lt;properName&gt;Bonn&lt;/properName&gt;,
he had just survived the war.&quot;<br>
Since &quot;Washington&quot; is annotated as a location in the first sentence,
it will be annotated as a location in the second sentence as well. Then the
2-Token symmetric environments of &quot;Washington&quot; are &quot;knows that is
the&quot; and &quot;came to , he&quot;. Since the second one matches the 2-Token
symmetric environment of &quot;Bonn&quot;, the Reasoner would conclude that
&quot;Bonn&quot; is also a location, just as &quot;Washington&quot;. In the
second round, the value reasoning would mmark every occurrence of
&quot;Bonn&quot; as a location, leading to new environments for the next
application of the environmental reasoning, leading to some new values again,
and so on.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Token Fraction Reasoning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Token fraction reasoning uses the individual
Tokens enclosed by Annotations of a particular source type to qualify the
Annotations of of a particular target type, which is different from the source
type. In particular, an Annotation of the target type is qualified if a given
percentage of the Tokens enclosed in it were also enclosed in some Annotation of
the source type. Token fraction reasoning needs four parameters:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to collect the Tokens from.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Match
    the Tokens case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Min % Known Tokens:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Percentage
    of Tokens of a target type Annotation that have to be in some source type
    Annotation for the target type Annotation to qualify.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Target Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of Annotations whose Tokens to compare to the Tokens collected from the
    source type Annotations.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume applying Token fraction
reasoning to the text passage below, using &quot;person&quot; Annotations as the
source type, and targeting Annotations of type &quot;properName&quot; (Annotations
marked with XML tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;&lt;person&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/person&gt; once was the playmate
of &lt;person&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/person&gt;. I have read that at the
bookstore of &lt;properName&gt;John Monroe&lt;properName&gt; around the corner.&quot;<br>
The Tokens collected from the &quot;person&quot; Annotations would be
{&quot;F&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Kennedy&quot;, &quot;Merilyn&quot;,
&quot;Monroe&quot;}. Since both &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Monroe&quot;, the
Tokens from the &quot;properName&quot; Annotation &quot;John Monroe&quot;, are
contained in this set, the Reasoner would conclude that &quot;John Monroe&quot;
is a person, just as &quot;Merilyn Monroe&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Token Sequence Reasoning</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Token sequence reasoning collects the Tokens
enclosed in Annotations of a particular source type (referred to as <b>known
Tokens</b> in the following) and annotates other combinations of these Tokens
that occure elsewhere in the document. It can also span a small number of <b>unknown
Tokens</b> (ones that were not enclosed in an Annotation of the source type) if
they stand between to known ones, and it can use a gazetteer list to filter
these unknown Tokens. The parameters for Token sequence reasoning are:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to collect the known Tokens from.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Match
    the Tokens case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max Tokens to Span:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Maximum
    number of unknown Tokens to span if standing between two known ones.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Token List:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Gazetteer
    list (see Lists) for filtering the unknown Tokens (relevant only if prevoius
    parameter &gt; 0).</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Use List for Inclusion:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;If
    checked, unknown Tokens are spanned only if they are contained in the
    gazetteer list. Otherwise, unknown Tokens are spanned only if they are not
    contained in the gazetteer list.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume applying Token sequence
reasoning over the text passage below, using &quot;person&quot; Annotations as
the source type, spanning a maximum of 2 Tokens (Annotations marked with XML
tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;&lt;person&gt;Jacky Kennedy Onassis&lt;/person&gt; was the wife of
John F. Kennedy. I have read that at the bookstore of &lt;person&gt;John
Monroe&lt;person&gt; around the corner.&quot;<br>
The Tokens collected from the &quot;person&quot; Annotations would be {&quot;Jacky&quot;,
&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Kennedy&quot;, &quot;Monroe&quot;, &quot;Onassis&quot;}.
Of &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Kennedy&quot; are
known Tokens now, and since we span 2 Tokens at maximum, &quot;F.&quot; will
bespanned, resulting in &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; being annotated as a person.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Annotation Joining</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Annotation joining works pretty similar to Token
sequence reasoning, except for the fact that it does not span unknown Tokens
between known Tokens, but only between Annotations of the source type. It also
can use a gazetteer list to filter the unknown Tokens. The parameters for Token
sequence reasoning are:</font>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Source Type:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The
    type of the Annotations to join.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case Sensitive:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Do
    the gazetteer list lookups case sensitive or case insensitive.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max Tokens to Span:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Maximum
    number of unknown Tokens to span if standing between two Annotations of the
    source type.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Token List:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Gazetteer
    list (see Lists) for filtering the unknown Tokens (relevant only if prevoius
    parameter &gt; 0).</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Use List for Inclusion:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;If
    checked, unknown Tokens are spanned only if they are contained in the
    gazetteer list. Otherwise, unknown Tokens are spanned only if they are not
    contained in the gazetteer list.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Example:</b> Assume joining Annotations of type
&quot;location&quot; in the Text passage below, spanning a maximum of 2 Token (Annotations
marked with XML tags):<br>
&nbsp; &quot;&lt;location&gt;Port of Spain&lt;/location&gt; is the capital of
&lt;location&gt;Trinidad&lt;/location&gt; and &lt;location&gt;Tobago&lt;/location&gt;.&quot;<br>
The Annotations marking &quot;Trinidad&quot; and &quot;Tobago&quot; would be
joined, spanning the intermediate &quot;and&quot;, and resulting in a single
Annotation enclosing &quot;Trinidad and Tobago&quot;. The Annotations marking
&quot;Port of Spain&quot; and &quot;Trinidad&quot;, however, would not be joined
because between them, there are the four Tokens &quot;is&quot;, &quot;the&quot;,
&quot;capital&quot;, and &quot;of&quot;, and we are spanning a maximum of 2
Tokens.</font></body></html>
