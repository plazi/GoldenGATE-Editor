Packer utility for GoldenGATE Configurations

This utility packs GoldenGATE Configurations into ZIP files, which it
deposits in the "_Zips" sub folder of the folder you run it in. The latter
should be the root folder of your local GioldenGATE Editor installation.
The main use is to pack up Configurations of your own creation that you
exported from GoldenGATE Editor, so you can distribute them to your users
more easily.
